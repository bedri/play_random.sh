# play_random.sh
An extremely simple music play interface bash script

It uses mplayer as a console player but you can use any console based player instead of mplayer.
Edit script, find mplayer and replace it with the console player you like.

This script works recursively for executed directory so you can run it from any directory to play any mp3 file under that directory (one of the sub directories).
